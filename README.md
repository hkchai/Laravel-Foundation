# Laravel-Foundation
Foundation 5 modules for Laravel 5. Requires Laravel and Foundation as Pre-Reqs

Since Laravel has out-of-box support for BootStrap, therefore if you happen to use Zurb Foundation (I do), there will be some plumbing needed.

For now this work is tested on:
- Laravel Framework 5.1.16
- Zurb Foundation 5

Available Module(s):
- Pagination: SimplePagination
